# Questionnaires
Scripts for questionnaires used by LCBC. 
All scripts are made specifically with the use of MOAS data (i.e. requires columns names a particular way).

They should always be annotated enough to be understood and adapted when used otherwise.

The scripts create functions in the global workspace, that you may call as any other R-function (ex. Fact_TAS(your_data) ). All the functions return the entire data frame with new data appended as columns. 

More information for the various questionnaires and scripts may be found within their respective folders, in their README.md files.
