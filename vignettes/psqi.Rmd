## Background
Despite the prevalence of sleep complaints among psychiatric patients, few questionnaires have been specifically designed to measure sleep quality in clinical populations. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven “component” scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score.

## Data requirements  
### Column names
Questions with multiple subquestions should be named in a similar manner, suffixed by the alphabetical index (**PSQI_5a**, **PSQI_5b** etc.). For questions 5j and 10j, the frequency of occurence should have the names **PSQI_5j** and **PSQI_10e**, and the freehand explanations should have any type of **suffix** after this to indicate a text answers (i.e. **PSQI_5j_Desc** or **PSQI_5j_string**, **PSQI_5j_freehand**). 
 As an example, LCBC has the following set-up:  
**PSQI_1**         
**PSQI_2**         
**PSQI_3**         
**PSQI_4**         
**PSQI_5a**  **PSQI_5b**  **PSQI_5c**  **PSQI_5d**  **PSQI_5e**  **PSQI_5f**  **PSQI_5g**  **PSQI_5h**  **PSQI_5i** **PSQI_5j**   **PSQI_5j_Coded**  **PSQI_5j_Desc**   
**PSQI_6**        
**PSQI_7**         
**PSQI_8**         
**PSQI_9**         
**PSQI_10**  **PSQI_10a**  **PSQI_10b**  **PSQI_10c**  **PSQI_10d**  **PSQI_10e**  **PSQI_10e_Desc**  **PSQI_10e_Coded**    
**PSQI_11a**       **PSQI_11b**       **PSQI_11c**       **PSQI_11d**  

### 4-option questions coding
All 4-option questions need to be coded **0-3**, not **1-4**.

### Time formats
For question 1, 3 and 4 (bedtime, rising time, hours of sleep), data should be punched as "**HH:MM**". 
Question 2 should be punched as minutes in numbers.
