## Background
Despite the prevalence of sleep complaints among psychiatric patients, few questionnaires have been specifically designed to measure sleep quality in clinical populations. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven “component” scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score.

## Data requirements  
### Column names
Questions with multiple subquestions should be named in a similar manner, suffixed by the alphabetical index (**PSQI_5a**, **PSQI_5b** etc.). For questions 5j and 10j, the frequency of occurence should have the names **PSQI_5j** and **PSQI_10e**, and the freehand explanations should have any type of **suffix** after this to indicate a text answers (i.e. **PSQI_5j_Desc** or **PSQI_5j_string**, **PSQI_5j_freehand**). 
 As an example, LCBC has the following set-up:  
**PSQI_1**         
**PSQI_2**         
**PSQI_3**         
**PSQI_4**         
**PSQI_5a** **PSQI_5b** **PSQI_5c** **PSQI_5d** **PSQI_5e** **PSQI_5f** **PSQI_5g** **PSQI_5h** **PSQI_5i** **PSQI_5j** **PSQI_5j_Coded** **PSQI_5j_Desc**   
**PSQI_6**        
**PSQI_7**         
**PSQI_8**         
**PSQI_9**         
**PSQI_10** **PSQI_10a** **PSQI_10b** **PSQI_10c** **PSQI_10d** **PSQI_10e** **PSQI_10e_Desc** **PSQI_10e_Coded**    
**PSQI_11a** **PSQI_11b** **PSQI_11c** **PSQI_11d**  

### 4-option questions coding
All 4-option questions need to be coded **0-3**, not **1-4**.

### Time formats
For question 1, 3 and 4 (bedtime, rising time, hours of sleep), data should be punched as "**HH:MM**". 
Question 2 should be punched as minutes in numbers.

## The components
- **Component 1: subjective sleep quality** - Answer to q 6.  
- Component 2: sleep latency** - Scaled sum of number of minutes before sleep (q 2) and evaluation of sleep within 30min (q 5a), scaled to a 5 point scale.  
- **Component 3: sleep duration** - Scaled score of number of hours before one falls asleep (q 4), scaled to a 5 point scale.   
- **Component 4: habitual sleep efficiency** - hours of sleep (q 4) divided by bedtime (q 1) subtracted from rising time (q 3), and scaled to a 5 point scale.  
- **Component 5: sleep disturbances** - Sum of evaluation of sleep within 30min (q 5a) and all remaining questions on sleep problems (q 5b-j), scaled to a 5 point scale.  
- **Component 6: use of sleeping medication** - Answer to question on use of sleep medication (q 7).  
- **Component 7: daytime dysfunction **- Sum of evaluation of staying awake (q 8) and evaluation of keeping enthusiastic (q 9), scaled to a 5 point scale.  
- **Global score: sum of the above.** If any of the above is not possible to calculate, the global sum is also not calculated.
